# Rfid- based door lock system

This project was made with electronics components like esp32, RFid reader and cards , solenoid door lock and relay modules in order to avoid using keys to open the doors in college.
The main highlights are it works even if lights are gone or not(doesn't fail even if all modules are not getting power).

# Tasks to be done
we have to interface it with server such that all the information regading who opened the door using RFId card can be saved there, and is available for future use .
